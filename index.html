  <h2>Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students:</h2>
    <p>I am pleased to welcome each of you to eighth grade English class! I look forward to getting to know all of you over the course of the upcoming school year. In order to succeed in your educational endeavors you will need continued support from your parents and loved ones. This includes assistance with homework, arriving at school in a timely manner, sufficient sleep, a healthy breakfast, and emotional support! Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, guardians, and other loved ones, thank you in advance for consistently encouraging your child to put forth their best effort.</p>
    <p>I am dedicated to creating a challenging, inviting, and stimulating learning environment for each student. This year the curriculum includes a variety of excellent literature along with virtual tools to provide a relevant, 21st-century education. The English program emphasizes critical thinking, analytical reading, oratory skills, and composition. Please read below to find out more about our academic agenda throughout the year!</p>
    <p>It is not only my great pleasure but also my promise to do everything within my power to help each student reach his or her fullest potential throughout the school year! But, success is also a studentâ€™s personal choice, which is why each day I expect every class member to choose to participate, accomplish their daily work, and both understand and follow the rules. It can be difficult for students to adjust to new classes; therefore, I would like to share with you some important guidelines and procedures that will help this year run smoothly. </p>
    <h2>The Golden Rules</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Be in your assigned seat and ready to work when the start bell rings.</li>
    <li>Enter class prepared with all books/materials and a present mind.</li>
    <li>Treat each person in the room with dignity and respect.</li>
    <li>Follow all directions the first time they are given.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Sincerely,</h2>
    <p>Ms. Rachel Pledger</p>
